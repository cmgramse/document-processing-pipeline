# Database Transaction Management

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of robust transaction management for the document processing pipeline, specifically focusing on chunk processing and state management in SQLite.

## Problem Statement

The original implementation encountered issues with transaction management and state consistency when processing chunks, particularly:

1. Lost updates during concurrent operations
2. Inconsistent states between embedding and Qdrant processing
3. Connection state issues
4. Missing transaction boundaries

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Transaction Management

The solution implements a robust transaction management system using context managers:

```python
@contextmanager
def chunk_transaction(conn: sqlite3.Connection, chunk_id: str):
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute("BEGIN IMMEDIATE")  # Lock the row
        yield cursor
        conn.commit()
    except Exception as e:
        conn.rollback()
        raise
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```

Key features:
- Explicit transaction boundaries
- Automatic rollback on failure
- Proper cursor management
- Row-level locking with "IMMEDIATE" mode

### 2. State Verification

Implemented state verification to ensure consistency:

```python
def verify_chunk_state(conn: sqlite3.Connection, chunk_id: str) -> bool:
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("""
        SELECT embedding_status, qdrant_status, qdrant_id
        FROM chunks 
        WHERE id = ? AND (
            (embedding_status = 'completed' AND qdrant_id IS NULL) OR
            (qdrant_status = 'completed' AND embedding_status != 'completed')
        )
    """, (chunk_id,))
    return cursor.fetchone() is None
```

This ensures:
- No orphaned states
- Proper state transitions
- Consistency between embedding and Qdrant states

### 3. Atomic Updates

All state updates are performed atomically:

```python
UPDATE chunks 
SET embedding_status = CASE 
        WHEN ? = 'completed' AND ? IS NOT NULL THEN 'completed'
        WHEN ? = 'failed' THEN 'failed'
        ELSE embedding_status 
    END,
    qdrant_status = ?,
    qdrant_id = ?,
    embedding = COALESCE(?, embedding),
    processed_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
WHERE id = ?
```

Benefits:
- No partial updates
- State consistency maintained
- Proper handling of NULL values

## Implementation Details

### State Machine

The chunk processing follows this state machine:

1. Initial State:
   - `embedding_status = 'pending'`
   - `qdrant_status = 'pending'`
   - `qdrant_id = NULL`

2. After Embedding:
   - `embedding_status = 'completed'`
   - `embedding = <binary data>`

3. After Qdrant Upload:
   - `qdrant_status = 'completed'`
   - `qdrant_id = <string>`

4. Failed State:
   - `status = 'failed'`
   - `error_message = <error details>`

### Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling:

1. Transaction Level:
   - Automatic rollback on failure
   - Error logging with context
   - State preservation on failure

2. State Verification:
   - Immediate verification after updates
   - Detailed logging of state transitions
   - Prevention of invalid state combinations

3. Retry Logic:
   - Maximum retry attempts tracked
   - Exponential backoff
   - Error count tracking

## Usage Examples

### Basic Transaction Usage

```python
def process_chunk(conn, chunk_id):
    with chunk_transaction(conn, chunk_id) as cursor:
        # Process embedding
        embedding = generate_embedding(chunk)
        cursor.execute("""
            UPDATE chunks 
            SET embedding_status = 'completed',
                embedding = ?
            WHERE id = ?
        """, (embedding, chunk_id))
```

### State Update with Verification

```python
def update_chunk_status(conn, chunk_id, status, qdrant_id=None):
    with chunk_transaction(conn, chunk_id) as cursor:
        # Update state
        cursor.execute(...)
        
        # Verify consistency
        if not verify_chunk_state(conn, chunk_id):
            raise Exception("Inconsistent state detected")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Transaction Management:**
   - Always use the `chunk_transaction` context manager
   - Keep transactions short and focused
   - Avoid nested transactions

2. **State Updates:**
   - Always verify state after updates
   - Use atomic updates where possible
   - Log state transitions for debugging

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement proper rollback mechanisms
   - Log errors with context
   - Track retry attempts

4. **Connection Management:**
   - Don't share connections between threads
   - Close connections properly
   - Use connection pooling for better performance

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Logging:**
   - Transaction boundaries
   - State transitions
   - Error conditions
   - Performance metrics

2. **Metrics to Track:**
   - Transaction success/failure rates
   - State transition times
   - Error frequencies
   - Retry counts

3. **Regular Maintenance:**
   - Database optimization
   - Index maintenance
   - State consistency checks
   - Error log analysis

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Lost Updates:**
   - Check transaction isolation level
   - Verify proper use of `chunk_transaction`
   - Look for concurrent access patterns

2. **State Inconsistencies:**
   - Run state verification
   - Check transaction logs
   - Verify atomic updates

3. **Performance Issues:**
   - Monitor transaction duration
   - Check index usage
   - Analyze query plans
